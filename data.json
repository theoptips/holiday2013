    "message":"Another year raced by. Our journey together has been incredibly rich, though we have only met for a short while. Thank you for making a special trip to San Francisco, and showing me a brand new San Diego. Each year, we create so many memories, exchange so many emotional moments! I love it! It's been an honor to be on this journey with you. Congratulations on completing STEP exams. Congrats on making strides towards fulfilling a special dream of becoming a doctor. Graduation is almost here. I wonder where would you choose to complete your residency. Should it be the bay area. It would be absolutely incredible! San Francisco loves you. xoxo - Dilys"
